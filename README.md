**📘 My DSA with Java Preparation**

*Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Java preparation repository! 🚀
This repo is a personal collection of my Java practice, problem-solving journey, and notes as I prepare for coding interviews and strengthen my fundamentals.*

**🔥 What’s Inside**

*✅ Java Basics – Core Java concepts (basics.java, Main.java)
✅ Recursion – Problems & patterns (recursion/)
✅ Bitwise Operations – Tricks & optimizations (bitwise/)
✅ Math for DSA – Number theory, modular arithmetic (math_for_dsa/, number_system_math_for_dsa/)
✅ Strings – String problems & algorithms (strings/)
✅ Arrays & Sorting – Sorting techniques & cycle sort problems (sorting/, problems_on_cycle_sort/)
✅ Searching – Binary search & variations (search/)
✅ Linked List – Implementations & problems (linked_list/)
✅ Trees & Graphs – (To be added 🔜 for advanced DSA practice)*

**🎯 Purpose of this Repository**

*To track my preparation progress in Java + DSA
To share my learning journey with others preparing for coding interviews
To serve as my reference notes for quick revision*

**🛠️ Tech Used**

*Language: Java ☕
Platform: IntelliJ*
